### 1. [Bash (Unix Shell Script)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bash_(Unix_shell)) 

&emsp;&emsp;In computing, Bash is an interactive command interpreter and command programming language developed for UNIX-like operating systems.

&emsp;&emsp;A shell script is a computer program designed to be run by a Unix shell, a command-line interpreter. The various dialects of shell scripts are considered to be command languages. Typical operations performed by shell scripts include file manipulation, program execution, and printing text.

### 2. [Batch](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batch_file)

&emsp;&emsp;A batch file is a script file in DOS, OS/2 and Microsoft Windows. It consists of a series of commands to be executed by the command-line interpreter, stored in a plain text file.

### 3. [C Language](https%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FC_%28programming_language%29)

&emsp;&emsp;C is a general-purpose high-level programming language suitable for low-level programming, in other words: a system programming language.  
It stands out in terms of portability, interoperability, efficiency, and stability.

### 4. [C++](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B)

&emsp;&emsp;C++ is a high-level, general-purpose programming language created by Danish computer scientist Bjarne Stroustrup.

### 5. [Java](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_(programming_language))

&emsp;&emsp;Java is a high-level, general-purpose, memory-safe, object-oriented programming language. It is intended to let programmers write once, run anywhere, meaning that compiled Java code can run on all platforms that support Java without the need to recompile.

### 6. [JavaScript](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript)

&emsp;&emsp;JavaScript, often abbreviated as JS, is a programming language and core technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and CSS. Ninety-nine percent of websites use JavaScript on the client side for webpage behavior. Web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine that executes the client code. 
### 7. [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/)

&emsp;&emsp;Kotlin is a cross-platform, statically typed, general-purpose high-level programming language with type inference. Kotlin is designed to interoperate fully with Java, and the JVM version of Kotlin's standard library depends on the Java Class Library, but type inference allows its syntax to be more concise.

### 8. [PHP](https://www.php.net/)

&emsp;&emsp;PHP is a general-purpose scripting language geared towards web development. It was originally created by Danish-Canadian programmer Rasmus Lerdorf in 1993 and released in 1995. The PHP reference implementation is now produced by the PHP Group.

### 9. [Python](https://www.python.org/)

&emsp;&emsp;Python is a high-level, general-purpose programming language. Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability with the use of significant indentation. Python is dynamically type-checked and garbage-collected.
